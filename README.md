# python-dataset
This is a python project completed with CodeFirstGirls, where I had to read a cvs file and display different types of manipulated data within the file.

Extra tasks I underwent was the user interaction, instead of re-running the program with different functions, or all functions at once, I decided to allow a user selection process where they could chose which file they wanted to view and the assigned functions with that file. As I downloaded raw data from Kaggle, along with the data provided, they came with different column names, meaning the functions I used with the provided dataset (sales.cvs) were different to thoes from the downloaded dataset (cars.cvs)
